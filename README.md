# How to Play

The game consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes represented by colored circles. The largest disk is at the bottom, and the size decreases as we move up.

The objective is to move all the disks from rod A to rod C, using rod B as an intermediate rod. The following rules must be followed:

1- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2- Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another rod or an empty rod.
3- A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
4- To make a move, follow these steps:

    - Click on the rod from which you want to move a disk.
    - Click on the rod to which you want to move the selected disk.
    - The game will display the current state of the rods and update them with each move. Keep making moves until you successfully move all the disks to rod C.
